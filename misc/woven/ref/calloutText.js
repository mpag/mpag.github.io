If their neighbours are too close, they move further apart; if their neighbours are too distant, they move closer together; if they change direction, they copy."

	"bodyContent":"These simple rules, extended to hundreds-of-thousands of starlings, result in emergent patterns of movement that appear inconceivably complex. A kind of floating fabric. At no two moments in time do the positions of flocking starlings ever combine to the same shape - an emergent property we can mimic with computer algorithms."

Where hand-based crafting techniques are limited by precision and manufacturing techniques such as casting are constrained by design complexity, 3D printing excels."

Each design comes with one of three dried flower arrangements; native wattle, baby's breath, or cotton ball.These Australian native arrangements are the work of Agatha Snape, a renowned Sydney-based florist."
